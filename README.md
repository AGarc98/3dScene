# 3d Scene

My approach to designing software changes depending on what kind of software it is. In using the openGL libraries I tried to reuse as much code to limit the amount of error introduced into functions. I focus mainly on creaitng the functions required first, then fine tuning how they need to be used in the main function to achieve the goals of the assignment.
When working on this project I had to read a lot of documentation and use some external threads to solve problems that came up. I also took the milestones as iterations of the project and simply improved on the project from week to week. Each milestone I was able improve the project linearly and get closer to the end result.
The skills acquired through creating this project have helped me gain a better understanding of how graphics get rendered on computers and the pipeline involved with getting the pure data from the memory and storage to the graphics renderer.
